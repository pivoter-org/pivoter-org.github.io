                <p>For decades, we have continued to face many of the same, lingering, fundamental social problems.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>There is a growing “Charity Gap” in Canada</strong> between the increasing demands for charitable services vs the ability for struggling charities to meet the demand. Imagine Canada projects that this social deficit will expand over the next 10 years unless we fundamentally change our current approaches.</li>
  <li><strong>Most community problems are the same as 70 years ago</strong>. We cannot feel proud of the continuing racism, gender inequality, income inequity, homelessness, deterioration of the environment, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Profit legislation and policies have barely improved since their creation well over 50+ years ago</strong>. We need to evolve these policies to better empower solutions for our social problems.</li>

                <h2 class="section--header" id="about">About Pivoter</h2>

<p>Pivoter.org is the flagship platform of The Pivot Project, an initiative founded and supported largely by <a href="https://giv3.ca" target="_blank">GIV3</a>, in partnership with <a href="https://communityfoundations.ca/" target="_blank">Community Foundations of Canada</a>, and « PARTNERS».
This is a small “coalition of the caring” interested in drawing greater attention towards, and fueling the narrative for improvements for the social sector. We believe that ALL Canadians should have a say in how their taxes are spent, and how government policies are enacted to better empower charities, foundations, non-profits, businesses and individuals to accomplish better.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure our policymakers have the ideal policy recommendations,
sourced from an open, inclusive, diverse, transparent, and non-partisan process.</li>
  <li>Empower social innovation, social capital, social impact and the greater civil society.</li>
  <li>Engage struggling Canadian charities, the millions of Canadians they support, and the millions of taxpayers who want to see their tax dollars put to better use in order to find solutions that work for everyone.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="approach">Approach:</h3>

<p>The Pivot Project seeks to provide a unique open platform that will help to develop, evaluate and disseminate ideas to fuel and empower the <em>pivot</em>.</p>

<p>This is NOT an initiative to own or control the evolution of the Social Sector. There will be many different independent organic initiatives from all sorts of people and places, leveraging their own strengths.</p>

<p>We just wish to amplify the narrative and strengthen the call for the necessary <em>pivot</em>.</p>

                    <p>Struck in January 2018, the committee was asked to examine and report on Canada’s charitable and nonprofit sector. While the sector is resilient and innovative, its potential is limited by what are seen by many stakeholders as complex, outdated rules and a lack of coordinated support within the federal government. The report presents 42 recommendations to Government to strengthen the Charity Sector</p>
